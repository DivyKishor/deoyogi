                    <p class="mb-4">Bihar is a state located in eastern India. Predominantly an agricultural economy, it
                        is the third largest state by population and twelfth largest by territory, with an area of
                        94,163 km2. Three main cultural regions converge in the state: Magadh, Mithila, and Bhojpur.</p>

                    <p>Only 11.3% of the population of Bihar lives in urban areas, which is the lowest in India after
                        Himachal Pradesh. Additionally, almost 58% of Biharees are below the age of 25, giving Bihar the
                        highest proportion of young people of any Indian state. </p>

                    <p>In ancient and classical India, the area that is now Bihar was considered a centre of power,
                        learning, and culture with two of the most renowned ancient universities of Nalanda and
                        Vikramshila. From Magadha arose India's first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one of the
                        world's most widely adhered to religions: Buddhism and another religion which goes by the name
                        of Jainism. Another region of Bihar is Mithila, which was an early centre of learning and the
                        centre of the Videha kingdom.</p>

                    <p>Since the late 1970s, Bihar has lagged far behind other Indian states in terms of social and
                        economic development. Many economists and social scientists claim that this is a direct result
                        of the policies of the central government, its apathy towards Bihar, lack of Bihari
                        sub-nationalism, and many other socio cultural political legal technological factors.</p>

                    <p>The state government has, however, made significant strides in past decade towards developing the
                        state. Improved governance has led to an economic revival in the state through increased
                        investment in infrastructure, and a reduction in crime and corruption.</p>


                    <!-- <h3 class="mb-3"><b>Arunachal Pradesh</b></h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">Arunachal Pradesh literally means "land of dawn-lit mountains" is the
                            northeastern most state of India. Land of the Dawn-Lit Mountains is the sobriquet for the
                            state in Sanskrit; it is also known as the Orchid State of India or the Paradise of the
                            Botanists. Geographically, it is the largest of the Seven Sister States of Northeast India.
                            Over 1.5 million residents of Arunachal Pradesh belong to the five Tani tribes.</p>
                        <p>Itanagar is the state capital. The state borders the states of Assam and Nagaland to the
                            south. It shares international borders with Bhutan in the west, Myanmar in the east, and a
                            disputed border with China in the north at the McMahon Line. A major part of the state is
                            claimed by both China and Taiwan as part of the region of South Tibet. During the 1962
                            Sino-Indian War, Chinese forces temporarily captured most of Arunachal Pradesh.</p>

                        <p>Arunachal Pradesh has close to 61,000 square kilometres of forests, and forest products are
                            the next most significant sector of the economy. Among the crops grown here are rice, maize,
                            millet, wheat, pulses, sugarcane, ginger, and oilseeds. Agriculture primarily drives the
                            economy. Jhum, the local term used for shifting cultivation is being widely practised among
                            the tribal groups, though owing to the gradual growth of other sources of income in the
                            recent years, it is not being practiced as prominently as it was earlier. Arunachal is also
                            ideal for horticulture and fruit orchards. Its major industries are rice mills, fruit
                            preservation and processing units, and handloom handicrafts. Sawmills and plywood trades are
                            prohibited under law. There are many sawmills in AP.</p>

                        <p>Arunachal Pradesh accounts for a large percentage share of India's untapped hydroelectric
                            potential. In 2008, the government of Arunachal Pradesh signed numerous memorandum of
                            understanding with various companies planning some 42 hydroelectric schemes that will
                            produce electricity in excess of 27,000 MW. Construction of the Upper Siang Hydroelectric
                            Project, which is expected to generate between 10,000 and 12,000 MW, began in April 2009.

                        <h3 class="mb-3"><b>Assam</b></h3>
                        <p>Assam is a state in northeastern India, situated south of the eastern Himalayas along the
                            Brahmaputra and Barak River valleys. Assam covers an area of 78,438 km2. The state is
                            bordered by Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh to the north; Nagaland and Manipur to the east;
                            Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Bangladesh to the south; and West Bengal to the west via the
                            Siliguri Corridor, a 22 kilometres strip of land that connects the state to the rest of
                            India. A significant geographical aspect of Assam is that it contains three of six
                            physiographic divisions of India – The Northern Himalayas (Eastern Hills), The Northern
                            Plains (Brahmaputra plain) and Deccan Plateau (Karbi Anglong).</p>

                        <p>As per the 2011 census, the total population of Assam was 31 million. The total population of
                            the state has increased in the last ten years with a growth rate of 16.93%. In 2011, the
                            literacy rate in the state was 73.18%. The male literacy rate was 78.81% and the female
                            literacy rate was 67.27%. In 2001, the census had recorded literacy in Assam at 63.3% with
                            male literacy at 71.3% and female at 54.6%. The urbanisation rate was recorded at 12.9%.</p>

                        <p>Assam is home to the one-horned Indian rhinoceros, along with the wild water buffalo, pygmy
                            hog, tiger and various species of Asiatic birds, and provides one of the last wild habitats
                            for the Asian elephant. The Assamese economy is aided by wildlife tourism to Kaziranga
                            National Park, on the bank of Brahmaputra River and Manas National Park, near the border
                            with Bhutan, which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Assam is one of the richest biodiversity
                            zones in the world and consists of tropical rainforests, deciduous forests, riverine
                            grasslands, bamboo orchards and numerous wetland ecosystems; Many are now protected as
                            national parks and reserved forests.</p>

                        <p>Assam is known for Assam tea and Assam silk. Assam's economy is based on agriculture and oil.
                            Assam produces more than half of India's tea. The Assam-Arakan basin holds about a quarter
                            of the country's oil reserves, and produces about 12% of its total petroleum. The state was
                            the first site for oil drilling in Asia. Assam has petroleum, natural gas, coal limestone
                            and other minor minerals such as magnetic quartzite, kaolin, sillimanites, clay and
                            feldspar. A small quantity of iron ore is available in western districts.</p>

                        <p>In the rainy season every year, the Brahmaputra and other rivers overflow their banks and
                            flood adjacent land. Apart from houses and livestock being washed away by floodwater;
                            bridges, railway tracks, and roads are also damaged by the calamity, which causes
                            communication breakdown in many places and in some years requiring food to be air-dropped to
                            isolated towns. Fatalities are also caused by the natural disaster in many places of the
                            State. The region is also prone to frequent mild earthquakes.</p>

                        <p>Unemployment is a chronic problem in Assam. It is variously blamed on poor infrastructure,
                            limited connectivity, and government policy; on a "poor work culture"; on failure to
                            advertise vacancies; and on government hiring candidates from outside Assam.</p>

                        <p>Assam's proximity to some neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan,
                            benefits its trade. The major Border checkpoints through which border trade flows to
                            Bangladesh from Assam are: Sutarkandi (Karimganj), Mankachar (Dhubri) and Golokanj.</p>

                        <h3 class="mb-3"><b>Himachal Pradesh</b></h3>
                        <p>Himachal Pradesh literary meaning "snow-laden province" is a state in the northern part of
                            India. Situated in the Western Himalayas, it is one of the eleven mountain states and is
                            characterized by an extreme landscape featuring several peaks and extensive river systems.
                            The state is almost landlocked with other states, but for a border with the autonomous
                            region of Tibet to the east.</p>

                        <p>Himachal Pradesh has a total population of 7 million. It has only 0.57 per cent of India's
                            total population, recording a growth of 12.81 per cent. The scheduled castes and scheduled
                            tribes account for 25.19 per cent and 5.71 per cent of the population respectively. The sex
                            ratio stood at 972 females per 1,000 males, recording a marginal increase from 968 in 2001.
                            The child sex ratio increased from 896 in 2001 to 909 in 2011. The total fertility rate
                            (TFR) per woman in 2015 stood at 1.7, one of the lowest in India.</p>

                        <p>Almost 90% of the state's population lives in rural areas. Agriculture, horticulture,
                            hydropower and tourism are important constituents of the state's economy. The hilly state is
                            almost universally electrified with 99.5% of the households having electricity as of 2016.
                            The state was declared India's second open-defecation-free state in 2016. According to a
                            survey of CMS – India Corruption Study 2017, Himachal Pradesh is India's least corrupt
                            state.</p>

                        <p>Himachal Pradesh has one of the richest reservoirs of biological diversity in the world. It
                            is also said to be the fruit bowl of the country, with orchards being widespread. According
                            to Forest Survey of India report, legally defined forest areas constitute 66.52% of the area
                            of Himachal Pradesh. The state is endowed with a high diversity of medicinal and aromatic
                            plants. Lahaul-Spiti region of the state, being a cold desert, supports unique plants of
                            medicinal value. As of 2002, the Himalayan region is undergoing large-scale irrational
                            extraction of wild, medicinal herbs, thus endangering many of its high-value gene stock.</p>

                        <p>Himachal Pradesh has around 463 bird, 77 mammalian, 44 reptile and 80 fish species. Great
                            Himalayan National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Pin Valley National Park are the
                            national Parks located in the state. The state has 30 wildlife sanctuaries and 3
                            conservation reserves.</p>

                        <p>Due to extreme variation in elevation, great variation occurs in the climatic conditions. The
                            climate varies from hot and sub humid tropical in the southern tracts to, with more
                            elevation, cold, alpine, and glacial in the northern and eastern mountain ranges. The
                            state's winter capital Dharamsala receives very heavy rainfall, while areas like Lahaul and
                            Spiti are cold and almost rainless.</p>

                        <p>Himachal Pradesh also ranks as the second-best performing state in the country on human
                            development indicators after Kerala. One of the Indian government's key initiatives to
                            tackle unemployment is the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). The
                            participation of women in the NREGA has been observed to vary across different regions of
                            the nation.</p>
